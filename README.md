# dice-telemetry
This repository is a simple POC to integrate opentelemetry with log4j

## Prerequisites
- docker
- python *(optionnal)*

## How to run
### 1. OpenTelemetry Receiver
Clone this repository and go in `dice-telemetry/docker` folder then run:
```shell
docker compose up --build
```
**For MacOs and Windows users**, make sure that docker desktop is launched and correct permission have been granted !

Build can take up to one minute

This will automatically install and build the project

### 2. Generate traces
In a second terminal, go in the root folder of the project

In each case, the scripts will generate one request per second. We will let those run for about a minute to have some information to display in the [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) UI
#### 2.1. If you have python installed (better)
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python test_service/generate_trafic.py
```
#### 2.2. If you haven't python installed
```shell
while : ; do
  curl "http://localhost:8080/rolldice?player=jack"
  sleep 1
done
```

### 3. See the results
Open a browser and go to [localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)
In the Service dropdown you should have `DiceTelemetry` or `TaskManager`, select it if not already selected.
click on `Find Traces`

And voila, all the requests to `rolldice` appears !

If you have executed the python script, you can see in the tags of each request the player name under `Tags` > `player.name` and the result he/she got under `Tags` > `dice.result`.

If not then the player name is set to jack by default but you can still view the dice result.
